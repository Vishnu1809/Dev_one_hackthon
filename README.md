DevOne Portfolio

Build your identity, not just your portfolio.

A modern, interactive, and personal developer portfolio built for DevOne Hackathon 2025 — designed to showcase creativity, skills, and individuality through clean design, smooth animations, and effortless customization.

Project Story: Build Your Developer Portfolio
Inspiration

In a world where résumés can’t capture a developer’s creativity, I wanted to build something that reflects personality and passion — a living portfolio that evolves with every project.
The DevOne Hackathon 2025 theme, “Build Your Developer Portfolio,” inspired me to transform this idea into a full-fledged web experience.

What I Built

A responsive, animated, and elegant developer portfolio website with sections for:

 Home / About

Projects

Skills / Tech Stack

Contact

How I Built It

The app was built using React + Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components and Framer Motion for animation.
Deployed on Vercel, it ensures speed, accessibility, and simplicity.

function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <Home />
      <Projects />
      <Skills />
      <Contact />
    </>
  );
}
